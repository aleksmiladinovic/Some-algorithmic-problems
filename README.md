## About

This repository contains some interesting algorithmic problems.
The tasks have mainly been featured on Serbian programming competitions, and are organized based on their type: graphs, trees, dynamic programming etc.  
The following list describes the division of tasks based on their nature and main ideas:  

**1. Dynamic programming** - tasks that include 1D or 2D dynamic programming ideas.  
**2. Graphs** - tasks that include algorithms such as BFS, DFS, Dijkstra etc.  
**3. Trees and Maps** - tasks that include structures such as BST, BIT, Maps etc.
